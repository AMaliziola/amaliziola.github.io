            <h1>Alexander Maliziola</h1>
            <p>
                Hello! I am a graduate student currently attending Georgia Tech's OMSCS program; I graduated
                from Montana State University in 2024 with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. This website
                intends to showcase the variety of projects that I completed during my time at MSU.
            </p>
            <p2>
                NOTE: These projects (barring this website) are sourced from my educational Github account, not my personal account.

                <h3>Database Manager</h3>
                <p>
                    This Java-based Database manager was created by myself and four other peers in an unsupervised
                    Agile environment over the course of a semester. Its intended usage was to act as a management
                    system for a charity in town, allowing them to track changes in information regarding the tenants they
                    housed (their current system is a very messy set of Google spreadsheets). While we were not selected for usage,
                    we nevertheless received high marks on our project.

                    I contributed heavily to the UI design of the program, and wrote the entire documentation.
                </p>

                <h3>Recursive-Descent Compiler</h3>
                <p>
                    As a capstone, I completed a pre-made but unfinished Java-based Recursive-Descent Compiler using
                    test-driven development. I have included the documentation portfolio of this project, as the amount
                    of supporting code not sourced by me would render the source code almost impossible to parse through
                    at a glance.

                <h3>Raspberry Pi Robot</h3>
                <p>
                    A robotics class tasked me to work with two peers in an unsupervised environment to program a Robot; required tasks
                    included UWB sensor navigation, on-screen action programming, and ChatGPT-powered speech recognition and order-following.

                <h3>Tailwind CSS Demo</h3>
                <p>
                    I created a demo of Tailwind CSS with a peer for a Web Development course; it highlights various functions of Tailwind
                    and includes various Javascript functions for different site features.

                <h3>Portfolio Website</h3>
                <p>
                    I created this website to host my portfolio. It is based in HTML, CSS, and Javascript, with the latter one being used 
                    for the selection dialogue on the Database Manager button.
